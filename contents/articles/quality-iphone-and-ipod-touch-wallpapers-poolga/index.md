I just came across a great iPhone and iPod Touch wallpaper site called [Poolga](http://poolga.com/en &quot;poolga iphone wallpapers&quot;), which features quality wallpapers from designers and illustrators from around the world. This isn't another cheesy wallpaper site. All the wallpapers have a great design flare to them and look like they were made by people with talent.

These guys mention that they hate the standard wallpapers and cheesy nature themes available everywhere. That's why we create our own, and thought it would be nice to share them. I'm in total agreement with them and love that they created what they did.

I'm always looking for cool new wallpapers for my iPhone. Even after I find one that I love, I eventually get sick of it and finding a new slick wallpaper brings new life to the every day use of my phone. Poolga will certainly help me more than one time in the future to find something cool without wasting countless hours looking through ugly wallpapers to find a gem. Poolga is definitely one for the bookmarks.
