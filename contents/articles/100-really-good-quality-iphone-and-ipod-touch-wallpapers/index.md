In my [last post](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technoholic.ca&#x2F;quality-iphone-and-ipod-touch-wallpapers-poolga&#x2F;), I wrote about Poolgo, a great little site with really good iPhone wallpapers. These are quality wallpapers made by real designers. Well, today I happened upon a [Smashing Magazine article](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smashingmagazine.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;100-really-beautiful-iphone-wallpapers&#x2F; &quot;smashing magazine article&quot;) with 100 really sweet iPhone wallpapers, which includes Poolgo in its list, but also includes way more other wallpapers. I just had to post and update with a link to this Smashing Magazine article, because it really goes way above and beyond what I wrote.

If you&#39;re looking for some great iPhone or iPod Touch wallpapers, you need to read [this article](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smashingmagazine.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;100-really-beautiful-iphone-wallpapers&#x2F; &quot;smashing magazine&quot;).
