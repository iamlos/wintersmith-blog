In my [last post](http://www.technoholic.ca/quality-iphone-and-ipod-touch-wallpapers-poolga/), I wrote about Poolgo, a great little site with really good iPhone wallpapers. These are quality wallpapers made by real designers. Well, today I happened upon a [Smashing Magazine article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/06/100-really-beautiful-iphone-wallpapers/) with 100 really sweet iPhone wallpapers, which includes Poolgo in its list, but also includes way more other wallpapers. I just had to post and update with a link to this Smashing Magazine article, because it really goes way above and beyond what I wrote.

If you're looking for some great iPhone or iPod Touch wallpapers, you need to read [this article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/06/100-really-beautiful-iphone-wallpapers/).
