When I used Windows, I used to use a program called ACDSee to scroll through large amounts of images within folders. It was a great way to quickly go through any type of images within a folder. This was also very useful because I tend to keep a lot of PSDs of web designs with various version of a design, so ACDSee made it really easy to scroll through and compare them. When I switched to Mac, I couldn&#39;t do this as easily anymore. I went on a hunt to find the best image viewer for Mac, and found a great open source solution in a program called [Xee](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wakaba.c3.cx&#x2F;s&#x2F;apps&#x2F;xee.html &quot;Xee&quot;). Xee is light weight, simple, and does everything the old ACDSee did for me. I highly recommend downloading this one.&lt;!--more--&gt;

iPhoto doesn&#39;t really work the way I want it to, since I don&#39;t necessarily want to import every folder of pictures I have on my computer into iPhoto. The new Cover Flow type preview in Leopard almost does an okay job, but I don&#39;t want to have to switch back and forth between Cover Flow view and list view, not to mention resize the Finder window, when I want to scroll through images using the scrollwheel. Preview.app doesn&#39;t cut it at all either. Xee, on the other hand, works just as I need it to. I go to an old archive folder of images, click on an image, and I can scroll through the images without needing to import anything anywhere. It loads images quickly and supports many different formats, including PSD, which was really a bonus for me. If you use &quot;[The Unarchiver](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wakaba.c3.cx&#x2F;s&#x2F;apps&#x2F;unarchiver.html &quot;the unarchiver&quot;)&quot; to unpack your .zip, .rar, etc files, then Xee provides another benefit: you can scroll through images within the archive before you even unpack it. That&#39;s pretty sweet.

So, if you&#39;re a switcher like me and you miss having the function of ACDSee on your computer, then you need to check out [Xee for the Mac](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wakaba.c3.cx&#x2F;s&#x2F;apps&#x2F;xee.html &quot;Xee for the Mac&quot;). I mean right now.
