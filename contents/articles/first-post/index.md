I've used WordPress, Drupal, and other platforms in past for personal blogs, and for the most part, they've always been
overkill for what I needed the site to do. I love the idea behind static site generators like [Wintersmith](http://www.wintersmith.io).

My reasons for using Wintersmith
- avoiding the LAMP stack for a simple site, and seeing HUGE performance improvements because of it
- getting to play with node.js some more
- giving Github pages a try, which makes deployment really easy
