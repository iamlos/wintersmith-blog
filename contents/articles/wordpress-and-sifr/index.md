I&#39;ve been tinkering around with sIFR over the last day and a bit in my free time, and I&#39;ve got it working on the site for the top level navigation menu and titles. I have to say, it&#39;s pretty sweet. Now, all of my blog post titles can show up smooth and crisp and I have way more control over the font on the site. I&#39;m really pleased with how it has turned out. It wasn&#39;t even difficult to implement.

I followed the [sIFR wiki](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.novemberborn.net&#x2F;sifr) and had it working to my liking within a few hours. It&#39;s even working nicely with my transparent PNG background fade, so I&#39;m happy all around this morning.
