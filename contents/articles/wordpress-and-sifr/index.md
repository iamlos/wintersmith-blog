I've been tinkering around with sIFR over the last day and a bit in my free time, and I've got it working on the site for the top level navigation menu and titles. I have to say, it's pretty sweet. Now, all of my blog post titles can show up smooth and crisp and I have way more control over the font on the site. I'm really pleased with how it has turned out. It wasn't even difficult to implement.

I followed the [sIFR wiki](http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr) and had it working to my liking within a few hours. It's even working nicely with my transparent PNG background fade, so I'm happy all around this morning.
