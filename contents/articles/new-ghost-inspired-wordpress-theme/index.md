Recently, I've been inspired by the Ghost blogging platform, which I think has a really clean and elegant default theme, so I built a WordPress theme that borrows from some of the ideas that I liked from that theme.

I wanted to rebuild the theme for this site, make it a little bit more modern, so I decided to fork the Bones starter theme, and start working on a nice new minimal design. I've decided to put the project up on GitHub for the sake of using GitHub. You can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/petethedude/technoholic.ca) if you want to see some of the code, or fork it for yourself. It's still very much a work in progress, but I'll be pushing the changes up there as I go.
