<p>I just came across a great iPhone and iPod Touch wallpaper site called <a href="http://&amp;/#x2F;&#x2F;poolga.com&#x2F;en%20&quot;poolga%20iphone%20wallpapers&quot;">Poolga</a>, which features quality wallpapers from designers and illustrators from around the world. This isn&#39;t another cheesy wallpaper site. All the wallpapers have a great design flare to them and look like they were made by people with&nbsp;talent.&lt;!—more—&gt;</p>
<p>These guys mention that they &quot;hate the standard wallpapers and cheesy nature themes available everywhere. That&#39;s why we create our own, and thought it would be nice to share them.&quot; I&#39;m in total agreement with them and love that they created what they&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>I&#39;m always looking for cool new wallpapers for my iPhone. Even after I find one that I love, I eventually get sick of it and finding a new slick wallpaper brings new life to the every day use of my phone. Poolga will certainly help me more than one time in the future to find something cool without wasting countless hours looking through ugly wallpapers to find a gem. Poolga is definitely one for the&nbsp;bookmarks.</p>

        </header>
        <section class="summary">
          <p>When I used Windows, I used to use a program called ACDSee to scroll through large amounts of images within folders. It was a great way to quickly go through any type of images within a folder. This was also very useful because I tend to keep a lot of PSDs of web designs with various version of a design, so ACDSee made it really easy to scroll through and compare them. When I switched to Mac, I couldn&#39;t do this as easily anymore. I went on a hunt to find the best image viewer for Mac, and found a great open source solution in a program called <a href="http://&amp;/#x2F;&#x2F;wakaba.c3.cx&#x2F;s&#x2F;apps&#x2F;xee.html%20&quot;Xee&quot;">Xee</a>. Xee is light weight, simple, and does everything the old ACDSee did for me. I highly recommend downloading this&nbsp;one.&lt;!—more—&gt;</p>
<p>iPhoto doesn&#39;t really work the way I want it to, since I don&#39;t necessarily want to import every folder of pictures I have on my computer into iPhoto. The new Cover Flow type preview in Leopard almost does an okay job, but I don&#39;t want to have to switch back and forth between Cover Flow view and list view, not to mention resize the Finder window, when I want to scroll through images using the scrollwheel. Preview.app doesn&#39;t cut it at all either. Xee, on the other hand, works just as I need it to. I go to an old archive folder of images, click on an image, and I can scroll through the images without needing to import anything anywhere. It loads images quickly and supports many different formats, including <span class="caps">PSD</span>, which was really a bonus for me. If you use &quot;<a href="http://&amp;/#x2F;&#x2F;wakaba.c3.cx&#x2F;s&#x2F;apps&#x2F;unarchiver.html%20&quot;the%20unarchiver&quot;">The Unarchiver</a>&quot; to unpack your .zip, .rar, etc files, then Xee provides another benefit: you can scroll through images within the archive before you even unpack it. That&#39;s pretty&nbsp;sweet.</p>
<p>So, if you&#39;re a switcher like me and you miss having the function of ACDSee on your computer, then you need to check out <a href="http://&amp;/#x2F;&#x2F;wakaba.c3.cx&#x2F;s&#x2F;apps&#x2F;xee.html%20&quot;Xee%20for%20<span class="ord">th</span>e%20Mac&quot;">Xee for the Mac</a>. I mean right&nbsp;now.</p>

        <section class="summary">
          <p>I&#39;ve been tinkering around with sIFR over the last day and a bit in my free time, and I&#39;ve got it working on the site for the top level navigation menu and titles. I have to say, it&#39;s pretty sweet. Now, all of my blog post titles can show up smooth and crisp and I have way more control over the font on the site. I&#39;m really pleased with how it has turned out. It wasn&#39;t even difficult to&nbsp;implement.</p>
<p>I followed the <a href="http://&amp;/#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.novemberborn.net&#x2F;sifr">sIFR wiki</a> and had it working to my liking within a few hours. It&#39;s even working nicely with my transparent <span class="caps">PNG</span> background fade, so I&#39;m happy all around this&nbsp;morning.</p>
