          <p>I’ve been diving deeper into jQuery lately, because a few clients have been requesting Flash-like functionality for their websites, and I’ve been avoiding Flash since before Steve Jobs made it cool to do so. I have to say, there is more and more that jQuery can do that Flash used to only do. I recently came across one great example of this while researching button effects for a personal project (release coming soon). Addy from AddyOsmani.com posted this great article about a shine effect using jQuery called <a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/shinetime/">&quot;ShineTime – A Kick-Ass New jQuery &amp;amp; <span class="caps">CSS3</span> Gallery With Animated Shine Effects.&quot;</a> The best part of the effect is that it’s so simple to implement and if you’re at all comfortable with jQuery and <span class="caps">CSS</span>, the method used with background-position opens up a world of possibility with other effects other than shine, which at least I wasn’t aware of. Check out <a href="http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/shinetime">his demo</a> to see the effect in&nbsp;action.</p>
<p>The entire thing really boils down to a few lines of jQuery Javascript code and some <span class="caps">CSS</span>. When a event happens, such as a hover or a page load, a shine PNG image is changed from a background position of off the screen to one that crosses to the other side off the screen. With a little modification, I made the effect display a few seconds after the page loads using setTimeout, rather than when you hover over an element, which produced a great little embellishment for a button or a logo when a visitors comes to the site. It’s a great little effect that you used to only be able to do with&nbsp;Flash.</p>

          <p>In my <a href="http://www.technoholic.ca/quality-iphone-and-ipod-touch-wallpapers-poolga/">last post</a>, I wrote about Poolgo, a great little site with really good iPhone wallpapers. These are quality wallpapers made by real designers. Well, today I happened upon a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/06/100-really-beautiful-iphone-wallpapers/">Smashing Magazine article</a> with 100 really sweet iPhone wallpapers, which includes Poolgo in its list, but also includes way more other wallpapers. I just had to post and update with a link to this Smashing Magazine article, because it really goes way above and beyond what I&nbsp;wrote.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some great iPhone or iPod Touch wallpapers, you need to read <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/06/100-really-beautiful-iphone-wallpapers/">this article</a>.</p>

          <p>I just came across a great iPhone and iPod Touch wallpaper site called <a href="http://poolga.com/en%20&quot;poolga%20iphone%20wallpapers&quot;">Poolga</a>, which features quality wallpapers from designers and illustrators from around the world. This isn’t another cheesy wallpaper site. All the wallpapers have a great design flare to them and look like they were made by people with&nbsp;talent.

        <section class="summary">
          <p>When I used Windows, I used to use a program called ACDSee to scroll through large amounts of images within folders. It was a great way to quickly go through any type of images within a folder. This was also very useful because I tend to keep a lot of PSDs of web designs with various version of a design, so ACDSee made it really easy to scroll through and compare them. When I switched to Mac, I couldn’t do this as easily anymore. I went on a hunt to find the best image viewer for Mac, and found a great open source solution in a program called <a href="http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/xee.html">Xee</a>. Xee is light weight, simple, and does everything the old ACDSee did for me. I highly recommend downloading this&nbsp;one.
